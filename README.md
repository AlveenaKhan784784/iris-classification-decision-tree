## Implemented decision tree model for Iris classification

## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that accurately classifies Iris flower species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on four key features:
- `Sepal Length`
- `Sepal Width`
- `Petal Length`
- `Petal Width`
## Features:
- `Sepal Length` (cm): Length of the sepal.
- `Sepal Width` (cm): Width of the sepal.
- `Petal Length` (cm): Length of the petal.
- `Petal Width` (cm): Width of the petal.
### Target: Iris species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

## Source:
- The dataset can be found at the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/iris)

Using a Decision Tree classifier, the goals are:
**Build a predictive model**: Train a decision tree classifier to predict the Iris species with high accuracy.
**Understand feature importance**: Analyze which features are most influential in distinguishing between the different Iris species.
**Model explainability**: Visualize the decision tree to understand how the model splits features to classify the species.
**Evaluate model performance**: Use accuracy, confusion matrix, and precision/recall metrics to assess the quality of the predictions.
